    "# Welcome to Full Stack Machine Learning's Week 1 Project!\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our project on sentiment analysis using a [Women's Ecommerce Clothing Reviews Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews)! As a Data Scientist, you'll often be tasked with building predictive models that help businesses understand their customers' needs and preferences. In this project, our main goal is to understand the importance of creating a baseline model as a starting point for further improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this goal, we'll be using a dataset containing reviews written by customers about women's clothing sold online. The dataset offers a great environment to parse out the text through its multiple dimensions, and because this is real commercial data, it has been anonymized, and references to the company in the review text and body have been replaced with \"retailer\".\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the project, we'll start by exploring the dataset, performing some basic cleaning, and establishing a baseline model using a simple algorithm. We'll then discuss the importance of this baseline model and how it can be used as a reference point for future improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, we'll also be creating a simple model that performs better than the baseline model. This will give us a better understanding of how machine learning models work and the benefits of using more complex algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're excited to embark on this project together and look forward to exploring the world of sentiment analysis with you!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using GitHub\n",
    "To complete the assignment:\n",
    "1. Fill in the TODO sections of this notebook.\n",
    "2. Push the results to your `full-stack-ml-metaflow-corise-week-1` repository.\n",
    "3. Create a link to the repository in Corise."

    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in the data science pipeline as it allows us to gain insights and identify patterns within the data. In this section, we will be performing EDA on the Women's Clothing E-Commerce dataset, which contains reviews written by customers. Through this process, we will be looking out for trends, anomalies, and outliers that can help us better understand the data and inform our decision-making in subsequent stages of the project. By performing EDA, we will be able to identify potential issues with the dataset and make necessary corrections before proceeding to the model building phase.\n",

    "### Filtering Stop Words\n",
    "In this part we will be filtering the stop words from the reviews. We remove stopwords in NLP datasets because there are words that do not carry much meaning on their own, and their presence can add noise to the analysis. These words are common and frequently occurring words such as \"a\", \"an\", \"the\", \"of\", and \"and\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Removing stopwords can improve the accuracy and efficiency of natural language processing tasks, such as sentiment analysis or topic modeling, by reducing the dimensionality of the data and increasing the signal-to-noise ratio. By removing these uninformative words, the resulting dataset may contain more meaningful information that can be used for analysis."

    "A basic baseline in a machine learning model is the simplest possible model that can be used to make predictions on the dataset. The basic baseline can be as simple as predicting the most frequent class for a classification problem or the mean value of the target variable for a regression problem. The purpose of establishing a baseline is to provide a benchmark for evaluating the performance of more complex models. A model that cannot outperform the basic baseline is considered to be useless and should not be used in practice.\n",
